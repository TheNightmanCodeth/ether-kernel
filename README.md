# Ether Kernel

This repo contains the source code for my custom android kernel, Ether.

Ether uses [android-linux-stable](https://github.com/android-linux-stable/wahoo) for a secure and stable base, and builds on it to provide *my* ideal balance between speed and smoothness.

Some headline features of Ether:

- Safety net patch 
- Compiled using Linaro toolchain
- DNSCrypt
- Custom color profiles

All coming soon!

# Building Ether

The build process for ether is the same as any other Android kernel. If this is your first exposure to compiling custom kernels, you should have a look at [nathanchance's build guide over at XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software-hacking/reference-how-to-compile-android-kernel-t3627297)

# Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome, but I probably won't accept them unless it's a bugfix or other critical change. As stated above this is my idea of the ideal Android kernel and nothing more. If there's a feature you think would be nice to have, open up an issue and I'll respond asap.
